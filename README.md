This project focuses on extracting and analyzing financial data for popular stocks to help identify patterns and trends. As a Data Scientist/Analyst working for a startup investment firm, I extracted historical stock price and quarterly revenue data for **Tesla**, **Amazon**, **AMD**, and **GameStop** using Python. The collected data was visualized in a dashboard to display key performance indicators and identify trends.

- **Watson Studio**: A collaborative environment for developing and deploying data science projects.
- **Python**: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Scraped and gathered financial data, including:
  - Historical share prices
