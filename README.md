Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

For this project, I will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. 

My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

I understand that a dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators in a clear way. I will be practicing analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators. I'll also be using prompts to support my learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard is included in this assignment. 

In the Python for Data Science, AI, and Development course, I utilized Skills Network Labs for hands-on labs.

For this project, I will use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses. Whereas Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy my projects.
